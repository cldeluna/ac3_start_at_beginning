# Start at the beginning - Automating Network Design

 We spend a lot of time talking about network automation for operations. I would like to shift our attention to design, which is where most projects really begin. For years now, it’s been a goal of mine to move away from monolithic drawings and documents that can’t be easily consumed programmatically to a world where our design starts with patterns and structured data. That’s where things begin. With programatically consumable design data, network automation can start at the beginning. Everything flows from that design data, the diagram, the document, the configurations, the connectivity, the build or work instructions. I think the AutoCon conferences have elevated the discussion around automation to a level where it is time to shift our focus to automating design. We also have tools available to us now that will greatly help with this but you can get started without them and I'd like to talk about that evolution.
